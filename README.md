# Verified quantum information scrambling

Final project, Caltech CS101: Introduction to Quantum Algorithms.

We replicate the work of Landsman, Kevin A., et al. "Verified quantum information scrambling." _Nature_ 567.7746 (2019): 61-65.
Simulations and IBM Q results of the probabilistic decoder is in `scrambling.ipynb`, while the deterministic (Grover's search) decoder is in `grover.ipynb`. Data is in `data/` and output plots are in `out/`.
